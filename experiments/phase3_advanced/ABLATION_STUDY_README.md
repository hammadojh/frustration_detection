# Comprehensive Ablation Study for Feature Importance

## Overview
This ablation study will answer the key question: **"Which features contribute most to our F1=0.8831 performance?"**

## What It Tests (~68 experiments total)

### 1. **Baseline Test** (1 experiment)
- **Text-only**: No features, just raw RoBERTa embeddings
- **Purpose**: Understand base performance without any engineered features

### 2. **Individual Feature Importance** (22 experiments)  
- Test each of the 22 features alone with early fusion
- **Purpose**: Identify which single features are most powerful
- **Output**: Ranking of all 22 features by individual performance

### 3. **Bundle-Level Analysis** (7 experiments)
- Test each feature bundle separately:
  - `linguistic_bundle` (8 features)
  - `dialogue_bundle` (4 features) 
  - `behavioral_bundle` (2 features)
  - `contextual_bundle` (3 features)
  - `emotion_dynamics_bundle` (2 features)
  - `system_bundle` (2 features)
  - `user_model_bundle` (1 feature)
- **Purpose**: Understand which conceptual groups are most valuable

### 4. **Top-K Feature Combinations** (6 experiments)
- Test top 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15 features together
- **Purpose**: Find optimal feature count for efficiency vs performance

### 5. **Leave-One-Out Ablation** (22 experiments)
- Remove each feature from the full 22-feature set
- **Purpose**: Identify which features are most critical (biggest performance drop when removed)
- **Key insight**: Features causing largest drops are most important

### 6. **Cumulative Feature Addition** (10 experiments)
- Add features one by one in order of individual importance
- **Purpose**: Understand diminishing returns and optimal stopping point

## Expected Outputs

### Files Generated:
1. **`comprehensive_ablation_study.csv`** - Raw data from all experiments
2. **`comprehensive_ablation_study_REPORT.txt`** - Human-readable analysis
3. **`ablation_progress_*.csv`** - Intermediate progress saves
4. **`ablation_final_progress.csv`** - Final backup

### Key Questions Answered:
1. **Which feature is most powerful individually?**
2. **Which bundle provides best performance?**
3. **Which features are most critical to overall performance?**
4. **What's the optimal number of features for efficiency?**
5. **How much does each feature contribute when combined?**

## How to Interpret Results

### Individual Feature Rankings:
- Higher F1 score = more powerful feature
- Look for features that achieve F1 > 0.83 alone

### Leave-One-Out Analysis:
- Larger performance drop = more critical feature
- Features with drop > 0.01 are highly important
- Features with drop < 0.005 might be redundant

### Bundle Analysis:
- Identifies which conceptual areas (linguistic, dialogue, etc.) matter most
- Helps understand problem from domain perspective

### Top-K Analysis:
- Shows efficiency frontier: performance vs number of features
- Identifies "sweet spot" for practical deployment

## Expected Runtime
- **Per experiment**: ~30-60 seconds on GPU
- **Total time**: ~45-90 minutes for all 68 experiments
- **Progress saving**: Every 5-10 experiments to prevent data loss

## How to Run
```bash
# Ensure you're in the right directory
cd /Users/omarhammad/Documents/code_local/frustration_researcher/experiments/phase3_advanced/

# Run the comprehensive study (will take ~1 hour)
python comprehensive_ablation_study.py
```

## What This Solves
Before this study, we knew:
- All 22 features together achieve F1=0.8831
- Individual features had varying mutual information scores
- But we didn't know actual **contribution** in the early fusion context

After this study, we'll know:
- **Exact importance ranking** of all 22 features
- **Optimal feature subset** for different performance/efficiency tradeoffs  
- **Critical vs redundant features** for model simplification
- **Domain insights** about which types of features matter most

This will enable us to:
1. **Simplify the model** by removing redundant features
2. **Focus engineering efforts** on the most important feature types
3. **Optimize deployment** with minimal feature sets
4. **Understand the problem** from a feature perspective

## Expected Key Findings
Based on our previous analysis, we expect:
- **Linguistic features** to dominate (especially `avg_politeness`, `avg_exclamation`)
- **System features** to be important (`response_clarity`, `response_relevance`)
- **Some newly fixed features** to show their true contribution
- **Diminishing returns** after top 8-12 features
- **Significant performance drop** when removing top 3-5 features

The study will quantify these expectations with precise measurements.
