### Phase 3: Optimization (Complete)
**Duration**: Comprehensive evaluation
**Objective**: Find optimal feature combinations
- ✅ 68 systematic experiments conducted
- ✅ Individual feature importance rankings
- ✅ Leave-one-out ablation study
- ✅ Top-K feature combination analysis
- **Result**: Optimal 8-12 feature configuration identified

## 🎯 Research Questions Answered

### ✅ "Which engineered features help BERT detect frustration?"
**Answer**: Linguistic features (politeness, sentiment, emphasis) are most effective. Dialogue structure features can actually hurt performance.

### ✅ "What's the optimal number of features for efficiency?"
**Answer**: 8-12 features provide the best performance/efficiency tradeoff. Diminishing returns after 12 features.

### ✅ "How should features be integrated with transformer models?"
**Answer**: Post-embedding concatenation works better than pre-processing. Feature scaling is critical.

### ✅ "Which academic literature translates to practical improvements?"
**Answer**: Politeness research (Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil), sentiment analysis (VADER), and emphasis studies translate well. Complex dialogue modeling features don't.
