# Frustration Researcher Project

This project is a literature review of academic papers on the topic of detecting and predicting user frustration in human-computer interaction.

## Key Components

*   **`downloaded_papers/`**: A directory containing the PDF files of the academic papers.
*   **`Frustration_Forecasting_Features.csv`**: This file contains a list of "features" that can be used to detect or predict frustration. For each feature, it provides a description, an example, and a discussion of how it could be modeled.
*   **`paper_feature_mapping.csv`**: This file maps the features from `Frustration_Forecasting_Features.csv` to the academic papers that discuss them.
*   **`feature_literature_mapping_frustration_combined.csv`**: This file appears to be a combination of the other two CSV files, providing a comprehensive view of the features and their corresponding literature.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art in frustration detection and prediction. This includes:

*   Identifying the key features that are indicative of user frustration.
*   Understanding how these features can be modeled and used in practice.
*   Mapping the features to the relevant academic literature.
