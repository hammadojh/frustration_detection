Here's your **revised blueprint**, integrating our prior discussion about *efficient experimentation*, *feature injection*, and *frustration detection* using BERT on datasets like **EmoWOZ**.

## 🔬 Efficient Experimental Blueprint: “What Actually Helps BERT Predict Frustration?”

This plan balances empirical rigor with practical constraints (compute time, feature overhead, latency).

---

### 1. ✅ **Define Feature Bundles (Structured, Modular, Switchable)**

Organize engineered features into switchable groups (for ablation and probing). Each group is encoded as a standalone vector.

| Bundle                    | Features Included                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Linguistic**            | Politeness markers, directness/abruptness, confusion cues, lexical sentiment score, sarcasm       |
| **Discourse / Pragmatic** | Sentiment trajectory (Δ-sentiment), intent repetition, conversation length, long-range repetition |
| **Behavioral / External** | Time gaps between turns, escalation attempts, help button usage                                   |

> 🔄 Each bundle is modular — keep it clean to enable **efficient dropout for ablation**.

---

### 2. 🧪 **Baseline Model Setup**

* **Model**: Vanilla BERT/RoBERTa
* **Input**: Raw dialogue history (up to 512 tokens)
* **Head**: Linear classifier
* **Labels**: Binary frustration label per user turn

Record metrics:

* `F1`, `Precision`, `Recall`, and optionally `AUC`

---

### 3. 🔍 **Optional: Probing for Feature Encodability**

Before training full models, run **lightweight probes**:

* Freeze pretrained BERT.
* Train a **logistic regression classifier** using BERT embeddings to predict each feature.
* If accuracy ≈ random:

  > 🔔 That feature is **not well-encoded** in BERT — **adding it will likely help.**

> ✅ Fast and low-cost — helps you **prioritize features** before expensive fine-tuning.

---

### 4. 🧠 **Full Feature-Augmented Model**

* Input: Dialogue → BERT → final CLS vector
* Add: Concatenate each **feature bundle vector**
* Classifier: MLP or linear head on `[CLS | features]`
* Option: Freeze BERT if compute is tight

This allows **BERT to handle semantics** while **structured vectors provide auxiliary guidance**.

---

### 5. 🧪 **Ablation Grid (Efficient, Incremental)**

Use an **ablation framework** that:

* Trains one model for each feature bundle combination (drop 1, 2, ...).
* Only retrains classification head or top layers (optional freezing).
* Uses a **ΔF1 metric** to measure feature contribution.

> 💡 Try “coarse-to-fine” ablations:
>
> * Start with full set → remove 1 bundle → observe loss
> * Only test bundles with non-zero ΔF1

---

### 6. 🎯 **Attention & Saliency Diagnostics**

For each ablation variant:

* Record **attention maps** (e.g., via BERTviz) or **SHAP values**
* Check whether “important” features actually shift model focus or influence output

> This helps **validate that improvements aren’t just statistical noise**.

---

### 7. 📏 **Stress Test with Long Dialogues**

Some features like `intent_repetition` and `conversation_length` **depend on full context**.

Run the top-performing model on:

* Long-context test set
* Longformer or chunked BERT
* See if features like `repetition` retain impact when full dialogue is visible

> Ensures your model **generalizes beyond short conversations**.

---

### 8. 🧠 **Select Best Model (Based on Value/Cost Trade-off)**

For each model variant:

* Log `F1`, `latency`, `# extra features`, `probe accuracy`, etc.
* Choose the best **feature-to-performance ratio**, not just highest F1

Use:

* 🧠 Occam’s Razor: prefer simpler model if performance is similar
* ⚡ Runtime-aware pruning: drop high-latency features with low impact

---

### 9. 💾 Final Outputs to Track

| Artifact                     | Purpose                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Metrics Table (F1/precision) | Track performance across experiments         |
| Probe Accuracy Scores        | Understand what BERT “already knows”         |
| Feature Impact Chart         | Visualize gains per bundle (e.g., ΔF1 plots) |
| Long Context Results         | Check robustness for multi-turn dialogue     |
| Final Model Latency Report   | Ensure deployment viability                  |

---

### 🔁 Bonus: Efficient Iteration Tips

* Start with a **small dataset subset** (e.g., 500 dialogs) for early experiments
* Use **frozen BERT + probes** to **weed out useless features early**
* Once narrowed down, fine-tune only on **surviving bundles**
* Use **wandb or TensorBoard** for ablation tracking

Would you like me to convert this into a Notion doc / markdown file for sharing? Or do you want Python scaffold code for the probing + ablation runs?
