Phase 3b: Feature Selection - Partial Results

Baseline (all 22 features): F1 = 0.8831

MUTUAL INFORMATION SELECTION:
âœ… MI_top_3: F1 = 0.8312 (Î”=-0.0519) | 3 features
âœ… MI_top_5: F1 = 0.8571 (Î”=-0.0260) | 5 features  
ðŸ”„ MI_top_8: [IN PROGRESS - timed out]

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Only 12 out of 22 features are non-constant (informative)
2. Top 3 MI features achieve F1=0.8312 (94% of full performance with 14% of features)
3. Top 5 MI features achieve F1=0.8571 (97% of full performance with 23% of features)
4. Significant feature reduction possible with minimal performance loss

EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS:
- MI_top_3: 0.8312/3 = 0.2771 F1/feature (highly efficient)
- MI_top_5: 0.8571/5 = 0.1714 F1/feature (very efficient)  
- All features: 0.8831/22 = 0.0401 F1/feature (baseline)

This suggests we can achieve near-optimal performance with just 5 carefully selected features!
